Simple CI/CD pipeline demo

## Getting Started

---
This is a repo where I practise cicd pipeline with Docker and Jenkins.

The CI server will get notified when there is a change in the code, then it will pull all the latest code from Github repo and tried to build a docker image. After passing the test and the pipeline will push the built docker image into Dockerhub for delivery.
